# Generative Art Experiment

![image](img/screen1.png)

Inspired by [Xavier Ho's presentation at 2018 Lambda Jam](http://lambdajam.yowconference.com.au/proposal/?id=6175), and [this article by Benjamin Kovach](https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-03-07-generating-art.html), this repo contains a demonstration of the new [reflex-dom-svg library](https://github.com/qfpl/reflex-dom-svg/) and some other pieces to also generate some interesting artworks.

This is all built using [nix] and the [obelisk] builder from [obsidian systems].

Work in progress, enjoy. :)
